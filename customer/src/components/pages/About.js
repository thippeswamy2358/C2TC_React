                    <p>I try to learn from everyone. I write down everything that makes sense to me and could 
                        potentially benefit me and increase my productivity.My view has been - I don't have enough 
                        
                        time to figure out a lot of these things on my own, so I've decided to abandon my ego and try to 
                        learn as much from others as possible.I wrote a book, in which I share everything I know about how to become a better, more efficient programmer.
                        I like finding new ways to save myself time - automating things, solving problems.</p>
